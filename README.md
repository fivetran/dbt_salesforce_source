# Salesforce ([docs](insert URL here after transform package updated)) 

This package models Salesforce data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fB6aCiX_C1lieJf55TbS2v1yv9sp-AHNNAh2x7jnJ48/edit#slide=id.g3cb9b617d1_0_237).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:
* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds freshness tests to source data
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Salesforce modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce).  The staging models:
* Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
* Name columns consistently across all packages:
    * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    * Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table.  For example, the user table's ID column is renamed user_id.


## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `salesforce` schema. If this is not where your Salesforce data is (perhaps your Salesforce schema is `salesforce_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  salesforce_source:
    salesforce_database: your_database_name
    salesforce_schema: your_schema_name
```

This package includes all source columns define in the `generate_columns.sql` macro. To add additional columns to this package, do so using our pass-through column variables. This is extremely useful if you'd like to include custom fields to the package.


```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  salesforce_source:
    account_pass_through_columns: [account_custom_field_1, account_custom_field_2]
    opportunity_pass_through_columns: [my_opp_custom_field]
    user_pass_through_columns: [users_have_custom_fields_too]
    user_role_pass_through_columns: [so_do_user_roles, and_this_is_a_fun_column, woohoo_im_a_column_too]
```
